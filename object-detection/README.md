# Object Detection using YOLO and OpenCV

This project demonstrates object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm integrated with OpenCV. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system.

## Features
- Real-time object detection.
- Supports pre-trained YOLO models.
- Easy integration with OpenCV for image and video processing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pre-trained YOLO weights and configuration files
